# Installation

## Requirements

- .NET 5+ or .NET Framework 4.x.
- C# language version 9 or later
- Roslyn 4.0 or later

## Add the NuGet Package to your project

All you need to do, to install Mapperly is to add a NuGet reference pointing to the package [`Riok.Mapperly`](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Riok.Mapperly).

<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="csproj" label="PackageReference" default>
      <CodeBlock language="xml">{`<PackageReference Include="Riok.Mapperly" Version="${useDocusaurusContext().siteConfig.customFields.mapperlyVersion}" ExcludeAssets="runtime" PrivateAssets="all" />`}</CodeBlock>
  </TabItem>
<TabItem value="dotnet-cli" label=".NET CLI">

```bash
dotnet add package Riok.Mapperly
```

:::info
To remove the runtime dependency of Mapperly add
`ExcludeAssets="runtime"` and `PrivateAssets="all"`
to the resulting `PackageReference`.
:::

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="pkg-manager" label="Package Manager">

```powershell
Install-Package Riok.Mapperly
```

:::info
To remove the runtime dependency of Mapperly add
`ExcludeAssets="runtime"` and `PrivateAssets="all"`
to the resulting `PackageReference`.
:::

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

<Conditional condition={!useDocusaurusContext().siteConfig.customFields.environment.stable}>

:::warning
This is a prerelease version of Mapperly and is not subject to semantic release.
The API may break in any prerelease.
Checkout the latest stable version [here](https://mapperly.riok.app).
:::

</Conditional>

### Release Channels

Mapperly is distributed through two release channels:

- [**Stable Channel**](https://mapperly.riok.app): Production-ready releases with full support for latest release. Install the latest stable version for production use. Subject to semantic versioning (breaking changes only in major version bumps).
- [**Next Channel**](https://next.mapperly.riok.app): Preview releases with upcoming features and improvements. These versions may contain breaking changes and are not subject to semantic versioning. Use for testing and early access to new features.

## Support policy

Only the latest version released on the stable channel is fully supported.
We strive to support all .NET versions that are currently supported by Microsoft.

### Preserving the attributes at runtime

Mapperly removes the attribute references at compile time by default (they have the `ConditionalAttribute`).
If you want to preserve the attribute references at runtime
you can set the MSBuild variable `MapperlyAbstractionsScope` to `runtime`.

```xml
<PropertyGroup>
  <MapperlyAbstractionsScope>runtime</MapperlyAbstractionsScope>
</PropertyGroup>
```

:::info
When preserving the attribute usages, the Mapperly package reference needs to include the runtime assets.  
Make sure `ExcludeAssets` on the `PackageReference` does not include `runtime`.
:::

:::info
`MapperlyAbstractionsScope` only works in projects referencing `Riok.Mapperly` directly.
Alternatively you can set a constant `MAPPERLY_ABSTRACTIONS_SCOPE_RUNTIME`:

```xml
<PropertyGroup>
  <DefineConstants>$(DefineConstants);MAPPERLY_ABSTRACTIONS_SCOPE_RUNTIME</DefineConstants>
</PropertyGroup>
```
