# v4.0

[![NuGet v4.0.0](https://img.shields.io/badge/NuGet-v4.0-blue?style=flat-square)](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Riok.Mapperly/4.0.0)
[![API Diff v4.0.0 / v3.6.0](https://img.shields.io/badge/API--Diff-v4.0_%2F_v3.6-yellow?style=flat-square)](https://www.fuget.org/packages/Riok.Mapperly/4.0.0/lib/netstandard2.0/diff/3.6.0/)

## Migration guide from v3.6.0

- `MapPropertyAttribute.ctor(string[], string[])` is marked as obsolete, replace either with `MapPropertyAttribute.ctor(string[], string)` or `MapPropertyAttribute.ctor(string, string[])`.
- Strict mappings are enabled by default, either use `MapperAttribute.RequiredMappingStrategy`/`MapperRequiredMappingAttribute` or revert to non-strict mappings (see [strict mappings by default](#strict-mappings-by-default)).
- If the `ExplicitCast` conversion is disabled, disable the new `EnumUnderlyingType` conversion too.
- Members of foreach mappings are now mapped, which may result in additional members being mapped or new diagnostics being reported.
- To account for changed diagnostics adjust your `.editorconfig` as needed, see [updated diagnostics](#updated-diagnostics).
- The ordering of the member assignments in mappings may change, if you rely on the order of members being mapped, you may need to diff and verify the generated source code.
- Well-known .NET immutable types are not copied, even if `UseDeepCloning` is enabled.
- For long property names, auto-flattening may not work anymore and may need to be configured manually by applying the `MapPropertyAttribute`.

## MapPropertyAttribute constructors

Since Mapperly does not support source nested member to target nested member mappings,
the constructor `MapPropertyAttribute.ctor(string[], string[])` is marked as obsolete
and will be removed in a future release.
Use `MapPropertyAttribute.ctor(string[], string)` or `MapPropertyAttribute.ctor(string, string[])` instead.

## Strict mappings by default

Starting with v4.0 Mapperly enables strict mappings by default with a severity of `Warning`.
Either apply `MapperAttribute.RequiredMappingStrategy`/`MapperRequiredMappingAttribute` or
revert the change by setting the severity of `RMG012`, `RMG020`, `RMG037` and `RMG038` back to `suggestion`.
See [EditorConfig](../configuration/analyzer-diagnostics/index.mdx#editorconfig)
on how to set the default severity of a given diagnostic.

## Enum underlying type conversion

A new `EnumUnderlyingType` conversion is added.
Whenever Mapperly tries to map from/to an enum and does not succeed,
Mapperly tries to map from/to the underlying type of the enum and explicitly cast the resulting value to the enum type.
Until v3.6.0 Mapperly used the `ExplicitCast` to enable/disable this conversion.
Starting with v4.0 Mapperly introduces a new `EnumUnderlyingType` conversion to enable/disable this conversion.

## ForEach member mappings

ForEach mappings now also map members and constructor parameters the same way as regular object-to-object mappings.
This may break existing code because a member that wasn't mapped before may now be mapped.
New diagnostics can also be reported for existing mappings
(e.g., if a new member is being mapped, but Mapperly cannot create a conversion for its types).

## Limited auto-flattening

Mapperly tries to flatten properties automatically.
For this Mapperly tries to access object members based on the pascal case member name notation of C#.
Starting with 4.0 Mapperly will only try up to 256 member path permutations.
Before all possible permutations were tried.
Auto-flattening can always be overwritten by applying the `MapPropertyAttribute`.

## Updated diagnostics

The following diagnostics are changed, removed or replaced.
You may need to update the `.editorconfig` files and your Mapperly configuration code.
See [EditorConfig](../configuration/analyzer-diagnostics/index.mdx#editorconfig)
on how to set the default severity of a given diagnostic.

| -------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `RMG009` | This is replaced by `RMG083` for immutable types. For read only members `RMG009` is used as in Mapperly v3. `RMG009` is not emitted anymore for automatically matched read-only members.                                              |
| `RMG012` | Starting with v4.0 Mapperly enables strict mappings by default with a level of `warning`. The default severity of `RMG012: Source member was not found for target member` changes from `Info` to `Warning`.                           |
| `RMG017` | `RMG017: An init only member can have one configuration at max` and `RMG027: A constructor parameter can have one configuration at max` are merged into the new `RMG074: Multiple mappings are configured for the same target member` |
| `RMG020` | Starting with v4.0 Mapperly enables strict mappings by default with a level of `warning`. The default severity of `RMG020: Source member is not mapped to any target member` changes from `Info` to `Warning`.                        |
| `RMG026` | `RMG026: Cannot map from indexed member` is removed, starting with 4.0 indexed members are ignored                                                                                                                                    |
| `RMG027` | `RMG017: An init only member can have one configuration at max` and `RMG027: A constructor parameter can have one configuration at max` are merged into the new `RMG074: Multiple mappings are configured for the same target member` |
| `RMG028` | `RMG028: Constructor parameter cannot handle target paths` is removed as this is now supported.                                                                                                                                       |
| `RMG037` | Starting with v4.0 Mapperly enables strict mappings by default with a level of `warning`. The default severity of `RMG037: An enum member could not be found on the source enum` changes from `Info` to `Warning`.                    |
| `RMG038` | Starting with v4.0 Mapperly enables strict mappings by default with a level of `warning`. The default severity of `RMG038: An enum member could not be found on the target enum` changes from `Info` to `Warning`.                    |
