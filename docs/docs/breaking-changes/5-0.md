# v5.0

[![Release notes 5.0.0](https://img.shields.io/badge/Release_notes-v5.0-green?style=flat-square)](https://github.com/riok/mapperly/releases/tag/v5.0.0)
[![NuGet v5.0.0](https://img.shields.io/badge/NuGet-v5.0-blue?style=flat-square)](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Riok.Mapperly/5.0.0)

## Migration guide from v4.3.1

- Only .NET Framework 4.8 and .NET 8.0 and later versions are supported. Earlier .NET versions may still work with new Roslyn compiler SDKs but are not tested.
- Mapperly now respects `IFormatProvider` overloads when mapping using `Parse` methods.
- The fullnameof feature does not apply automatically to three-segment paths.

### `fullnameof` fix

In previous versions, the `fullnameof` feature was accidentally applied automatically to three-segment paths, even without the `@` prefix.
This behavior has been corrected, and the `@` prefix is now required to enable the feature.

To migrate, review your codebase and ensure that all three-segment paths are prefixed with `@` if the full name is expected (instead of just the last segment).

Example:

```csharp
[MapProperty(nameof(Car.Make.Id), nameof(CarDto.MakeId))]
```

In previous versions this resulted in:

```csharp
[MapProperty("Make.Id", "MakeId")]
```

In v5.0 this will result in:

```csharp
[MapProperty("Id", "MakeId")]
```

Unless `fullnameof` is applied:

```csharp
[MapProperty(nameof(@Car.Make.Id), nameof(CarDto.MakeId))]
```

Which will result in:

```csharp
[MapProperty("Make.Id", "MakeId")]
```

See also the [full-nameof documentation](../configuration/full-nameof.md).
