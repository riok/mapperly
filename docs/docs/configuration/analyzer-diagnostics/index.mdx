# Analyzer diagnostics

Mapperly emits several diagnostics:

<AnalyzerRules></AnalyzerRules>

:::info
Mapperly only emits updated source code on build.
You won't see the updated mapper code or mapper diagnostics until you perform a build.

This is done for performance reasons,
otherwise the IDE could become laggy.
:::

## Editorconfig

The severity of these diagnostics can be customized via an `.editorconfig` file:

```editorconfig title=".editorconfig"
[*.cs]
dotnet_diagnostic.{RuleID}.severity = error
dotnet_diagnostic.RMG020.severity = error
```

See also [code analysis configurations](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/fundamentals/code-analysis/configuration-options)
and [available severity levels](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/fundamentals/code-analysis/configuration-options#severity-level).

## Suppress diagnostics

See the Microsoft documentation on how to suppress diagnostics in C# [here](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/fundamentals/code-analysis/suppress-warnings).
In summary, you can use one of the following approaches:

- Use the `.editorconfig` file (for an entire file, directory or project, depending on the editorconfig scope)  
  `dotnet_diagnostic.RMG066.severity = none`
- Use the `SuppressMessageAttribute` (for a method)  
  `[SuppressMessage("Mapper", "RMG066:No members are mapped in an object mapping")]`
- Use precompiler directives (for specific lines of code)  
  `#pragma warning disable RMG066 // No members are mapped in an object mapping`  
  `#pragma warning restore RMG066 // No members are mapped in an object mapping`
