# User-implemented mapping methods

If Mapperly cannot generate a mapping, one can implement it manually simply by providing a method body in the mapper declaration:

```csharp
[Mapper]
public partial class CarMapper
{
    public partial CarDto CarToCarDto(Car car);

    // highlight-start
    private int TimeSpanToHours(TimeSpan t) => t.Hours;
    // highlight-end
}
```

Whenever Mapperly needs a mapping from `TimeSpan` to `int` inside the `CarMapper` implementation, it will use the provided implementation.
The types of the user-implemented mapping method need to match the types to map exactly, including nullability.

If there are multiple user-implemented mapping methods suiting the given type-pair, by default, the first one is used.
This can be customized by using [automatic user-implemented mapping method discovery](#automatic-user-implemented-mapping-method-discovery)
and [default user-implemented mapping method](#default-user-implemented-mapping-method).

## Automatic user-implemented mapping method discovery

By default, user implemented mapping methods are discovered automatically.
This can be disabled by setting `AutoUserMappings` to `false`.
With `AutoUserMappings` disabled, only methods marked by the `UserMappingAttribute` are discovered by Mapperly.

```csharp
// highlight-start
[Mapper(AutoUserMappings = false)]
// highlight-end
public partial class CarMapper
{
    public partial CarDto CarToCarDto(Car car);

    // highlight-start
    // mark as user-implemented mapping
    [UserMapping]
    // highlight-end
    private int TimeSpanToHours(TimeSpan t) => t.Hours;

    private int IgnoredTimeSpanToHours(TimeSpan t) => t.Minutes / 60;
}
```

The `AutoUserMappings` value also applies to the usage of external mappers:
With `AutoUserMappings` enabled all methods with a mapping method signature are discovered.
With `AutoUserMappings` disabled, only methods with a `UserMappingAttribute` and,
if the containing class has a `MapperAttribute`, partial methods are discovered.

## Ignoring a user-implemented mapping method

To ignore a user-implemented mapping method with enabled `AutoUserMappings`,
`[UserMapping(Ignore = true)]` can be applied.

```csharp
[Mapper]
public partial class CarMapper
{
    public partial CarDto CarToCarDto(Car car);

    // highlight-start
    // discovered and used by default (AutoUserMappings is true by default)
    // highlight-end
    private int TimeSpanToHours(TimeSpan t) => t.Hours;

    // highlight-start
    // ignored user-implemented mapping
    [UserMapping(Ignore = true)]
    // highlight-end
    private int IgnoredTimeSpanToHours(TimeSpan t) => t.Minutes / 60;
}
```

## Default user-implemented mapping method

Whenever Mapperly will need a mapping for a given type-pair,
it will use the default user-implemented mapping.
A user-implemented mapping is considered the default mapping for a type-pair
if `Default = true` is set on the `UserMapping` attribute.
If no user-implemented mapping with `Default = true` exists and `AutoUserMappings` is enabled,
the first user-implemented mapping which has an unspecified `Default` value is used.
For each type-pair only one default mapping can exist.

If multiple mappings exist for the same type-pair without a default mapping, `RMG060` is reported.
By default `RMG060` has a severity of warning,
which can be changed using the [`.editorconfig`](./analyzer-diagnostics/index.mdx#editorconfig).

## Map properties using user-implemented mappings

See [user-implemented property conversions](./mapper.mdx#user-implemented-property-mappings).

## Use external mappings

Mapperly can also consider mappings implemented in other classes.
In order for Mapperly to find the mappings, they must be made known with `UseMapper` / `UseStaticMapper`.

<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="static" label="Static">
  
  For static mappings, `UseStaticMapper` can be used:
  
  ```csharp
  [Mapper]
  // highlight-start
  [UseStaticMapper(typeof(BananaMapper))]
  // highlight-end
  public static partial class BoxMapper
  {
    public static partial BananaBox MapBananaBox(BananaBoxDto dto);
  }
  
  public static class BananaMapper
  {
    public static Banana MapBanana(BananaDto dto)
      => new Banana(dto.Weigth);
  }
  ```
  
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="instance" label="Instance">
  
  To use the mappings of an object instance `UseMapper` can be used:
  
  ```csharp
  [Mapper]
  public static partial class BoxMapper
  {
      // highlight-start
      [UseMapper]
      private readonly BananaMapper _bananaMapper = new();
      // highlight-end
  
      public static partial BananaBox MapBananaBox(BananaBoxDto dto);
  }
  
  public static class BananaMapper
  {
      public static Banana MapBanana(BananaDto dto)
          => new Banana(dto.Weigth);
  }
  ```
  
  :::info
  The initialization of fields and properties annotated with `UseMapper` needs to be done by the user.
  :::
  
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

Whenever Mapperly needs a mapping from `BananaBox` to `BananaBoxDto` inside the `BoxMapper` implementation,
it will use the provided implementation by the `BananaMapper`.

Used mappers themselves can be Mapperly backed classes.  
The [`AutoUserMappings`](#automatic-user-implemented-mapping-method-discovery) value also applies to the usage of external mappers.
