# Reusing Mapping Configurations

Mapperly supports reusing mapping configurations across different mapping methods using the
`IncludeMappingConfigurationAttribute`. This enables you to share and modularize mapping logic for consistent
behavior across multiple methods.

## Defining and Reusing Mapping Configurations

### Including an Existing Mapping Configuration

To include an existing mapping configuration in another mapping method, use the `IncludeMappingConfigurationAttribute`
and provide the method name:

```csharp
// Property mapping configurations
public partial static void CopyApple(AppleDto dto, Apple apple);

[IncludeMappingConfiguration(nameof(CopyApple))]
public partial static AppleDto ToApple(Apple apple);
```

The following configurations will be included:

- `MapProperty`
- `MapPropertyFromSource`
- `MapperIgnoreTarget`
- `MapperIgnoreSource`
- `MapperIgnoreObsoleteMembers`
- `MapperRequiredMapping`
- `MapValue`
- `MapDerivedType`

### Including a Mapping Configuration from a Base Class

This attribute also supports including configurations from a base class. For example, suppose you want to map
`Apple` to `AppleDto` and the mapping logic is defined for the base classes `Fruit` to `FruitDto`.
Here's how to set it up:

```csharp
class Fruit
{
    public string Name { get; set; }
    public decimal PricePerUnit { get; set; }
}

class FruitDto
{
    public string Title { get; set; }
}

class Apple : Fruit
{
    public int Weight { get; set; }
}

class AppleDto : FruitDto
{
    public int Weight { get; set; }
}

[Mapper]
public partial class MyMapper {
    [MapProperty(nameof(Fruit.Name), nameof(FruitDto.Title))]
    [MapperIgnoreSource(nameof(Fruit.PricePerUnit))]
    private partial FruitDto ToFruit(Fruit fruit);

    [IncludeMappingConfiguration(nameof(ToFruit))]
    public partial static AppleDto Map(Apple apple);
}
```

## Restrictions

- This attribute can only include mapping configurations defined in the same class. Configurations from other classes currently cannot be included.
- The attribute only reuses a mapping if the mapped types are the same or a base type of the mapped type.
- If the attribute includes configurations that cause a collision, it is reported as an error.

## Diagnostics

If an `IncludeMappingConfigurationAttribute` refers to an ambiguous mapping configuration (e.g., multiple
configurations exist with the same name), the mapper emits RMG062 to help you resolve the ambiguity.
