# Architecture

Mapperly is an incremental .NET source generator implementation.
Source generators are explained [here](https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/blob/main/docs/features/source-generators.cookbook.md)
and [here](https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/blob/main/docs/features/incremental-generators.md).

## Solution

- `benchmarks` Benchmarks to analyze the performance of the generated code and the source generator itself
- `build` Build scripts
- `docs` Documentation of Mapperly
- `samples` Sample implementations of Mappers using Mapperly
- `src` Source code of Mapperly
  - `Riok.Mapperly` The source generator implementation
  - `Riok.Mapperly.Abstractions` Abstractions and attributes to be used by the application code to configure Mapperly.
    This is referenced by the source generator but is not needed at runtime
    (except for some features, e.g., reference handling).
- `test` Unit- and integration tests of Mapperly

## Flow

This describes the process implemented by Mapperly on a higher level.
For each discovered `MapperAttribute` a new `DescriptorBuilder` is created.
The `DescriptorBuilder` is responsible to build a `MapperDescriptor` which holds all the mappings.
The `DescriptorBuilder` does this by following this process:

1. Extracting the configuration from the attributes
2. Extracting user implemented and user defined mapping methods.
   It instantiates a `User*Mapping` (eg. `UserDefinedNewInstanceMethodMapping`) for each discovered mapping method and adds it to the queue of mappings to work on.
3. Extracting user implemented object factories
4. Extracting user implemented format providers
5. Extracting external mappings
6. For each mapping in the queue the `DescriptorBuilder` tries to build its implementation bodies.
   This is done by a so called `*MappingBodyBuilder`.
   A mapping body builder tries to map each property from the source to the target.
   To do this, it asks the `DescriptorBuilder` to create mappings for the according types.
   To create a mapping from one type to another, the `DescriptorBuilder` loops through a set of `*MappingBuilder`s.
   Each of the mapping builders try to create a mapping (an `ITypeMapping` implementation) for the asked type mapping by using
   one approach on how to map types (eg. an explicit cast is implemented by the `ExplicitCastMappingBuilder`).
   These mappings are queued in the queue of mappings which need the body to be built.
7. The `SourceEmitter` emits the code described by the `MapperDescriptor` and all its mappings.
   The syntax objects are created by using `SyntaxFactory` and `SyntaxFactoryHelper`.
   The `SyntaxFactoryHelper` tries to simplify creating formatted syntax trees.
   If indentation is needed,
   the `SyntaxFactoryHelper` instance of the `SourceEmitterContext`/`TypeMappingBuildContext` can be used.

## Roslyn multi targeting

Mapperly targets multiple Roslyn versions by building multiple NuGet packages
and merging them together into a single one.
Multi-targeting is needed to support new language features,
such as required members introduced in C# 11,
while still supporting older compiler versions.

See `build/package.sh` for details.

To introduce support for a new roslyn version see [common tasks](./common-tasks.md#add-support-for-a-new-roslyn-version).

## C# language features

The Mapperly source generator targets `.netstandard2.0` but uses the latest C# language version
and polyfills generated by [`Meziantou.Polyfill`](https://github.com/meziantou/Meziantou.Polyfill).
Some newer C# language features require new runtime features and therefore cannot be used in Mapperly.
A good C# language features requirements overview is available [here](https://sergeyteplyakov.github.io/Blog/c%23/2024/03/06/CSharp_Language_Features_vs_Target_Frameworks.html).
